Paradigm Overview:

Structured Programming
Object oriented programming
Functional programming

Object oriented programming:

Ole Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard noticed that function call stack can be moved to heap. This way the local variables
declared can live longer after function returns. Function became constructor and local variables became instance variables.

OOP imposes discipline of indirect transfer of control.

EACH PARADIGM REMOVES CAPABILITIES FROM PROGRAMMERS THAN GIVING ANY NEW.

EACH PARADIGMS TELL US WHAT NOT TO DO MORE THAN TELLING US WHAT TO DO.
