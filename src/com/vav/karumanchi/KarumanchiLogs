	1. separate chaining
	2. remove duplicates in array n2
	3. sorting to remove dups
	4. single pass hash table for above problem
	5. 2 arrays of unordered numbers , find if both have same set of numbers (if they have dups) n2 by moving compared elements to end of list
	6. improve complexity of 5 using sorting nlogn and then scanning array with 2 pointers to find same elements
	7. using hashtables, save all elements in a hashtable, increase counter value by 1 for dups. check every element in second array and decrease counter , then go over the entire hashtable to see if all 0s
