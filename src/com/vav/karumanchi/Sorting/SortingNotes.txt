1. Bubble Sort
    A. Bubble sort moves the largest element at the end of the list, can do vice versa too.
    B. We use outer loop from n-1 to 0 where largest value is moved to last cell every iteration of inner loop.
    C. Inner loop starts from 0- n-1 and compares and swaps n+1 to n every iteration.

2. Selection Sort
    A. Selection sort is similar to bubble sort but we do not swap every inner loop iteration.
    B. In selection sort we start outer loop 0-n-1 and inner loop i+1 - n-1.
    C. Every inner loop we compare every value from i+1 to n-1 with the flagged value.
    D. if we find any value smaller than flagged value we flag the new value.
    E. After complete inner loop we find the smallest value and we assign it to ith node.

3. Insertion Sort:
    A. In Insertion sort we leave the first cell and start from 1 to n-1
    B. Before starting second loop we save the first value.
    C. we start the second loop from i -> 0 and we check if i-1 th value is greater than saved value.
    D. if i-1 th value is greater than saved value then we move the i-1th value to ith and we keep doing it until we reach 0.
    E. At the end we save the temp value to left most cell left empty.
