Encapsulation:

Drawing a line around a cohesive set of data and functions.

In C programming language we have perfect encapsulation, all the methods are defined in header files and data remains in
implementation files.
C++ on thee other hand has broken encapsulation. We have to define data members in the header file that lets others
know about the data members available in our class, even if they are declared private.
Java has even broken encapsulation where we dont even have header classes.
