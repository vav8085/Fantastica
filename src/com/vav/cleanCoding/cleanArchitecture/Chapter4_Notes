Structured Programming

Proof:
A program of any complexity contains too many detail for a human brain to manage without help.

All programs can be created from just 3 structures
Sequence
Selection
Iteration

Sequential steps can be proved correct by simple enumeration.

Induction is used to prove iteration correct.
case 1 can be proved by enumeration
Case N can be assumed correct
N+1 is correct by enumeration.

Goto is not a part of most of the current programming languages. Those that have it still allow it within a function.

Scientific theories are falsifiable(testable) but not provable

Science works by proving statements false unlike maths

TESTING SHOWS THE PRESENCE NOT THE ABSENCE OF BUGS.

A program can be proved incorrect by testing but it cannot measure its correctness.

***A tester can deem a program correct enough to work.
We show correctness by failing to prove incorrectness in software engineering.
