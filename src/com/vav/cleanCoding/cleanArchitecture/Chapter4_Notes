Structured Programming

Proof:
A program of any complexity contains too many detail for a human brain to manage without help.

All programs can be created from just 3 structures
Sequence
Selection
Iteration

Sequential steps can be proved correct by simple enumeration.

Induction is used to prove iteration correct.
case 1 can be proved by enumeration
Case N can be assumed correct
N+1 is correct by enumeration.

Goto is not a part of most of the current programming languages. Those that have it still allow it within a function.
