Chapter 1

Design and Architecture

The goal of the software architecture is the minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system.

The measure of design quality is simply the effort required to meet the needs of customer. If that effort is low and stays low
throughout the lifetime of the system. The design is good. If the effort grows with each new release then the design is bad.

Few things to consider when productivity is declining:
1.  Growth of the development staff is increasing. - Engineering staff vs release
2.  Lines of code is reaching an asymptote then its a problem. - LOC vs release
3.  Productivity is going down with every release. - % productivity vs release
4.  Time to implement features is going in managing the mess

What declined the productivity:
1.  The lie of cleaning it up later
2.  You cannot beat market competition by running faster and ignoring the architecture.
3.  Features keep coming, cleaning up now is the key to success throughout the product lifecycle.

MAKING MESS IS ALWAYS SLOWER THAN STAYING CLEAN
Delivering faster is not the key.

THE ONLY WAY TO GO FAST IS TO GO WELL

THEIR OVERCONFIDENCE WILL DRIVE THE REDESIGN INTO THE SAME MESS AS THE OROGINAL PROJECT
