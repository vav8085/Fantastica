This file contains the main topics that i need to cover on trees. I am referring Karumanchi, Princeton Algorithms 1 and Robert Lafore
for theory and CTCI, Leetcode for Practice.

All the code can be found in Common folder for tree implementations, separate folders for each exercise book.

1.  Trees
2.  Binary Trees
3.  Binary Tree Traversal using loops and recursion
4.  Generic Trees(N ary)
5.  Threaded Binary trees
6.  Threaded tree traversal
7.  Expression Trees
8.  BST
9.  BST Operations
10. Balanced BST
11. AVL trees
12. Tree rotations
13. Red black trees
14. Binary Heeps
15. Priority Queues
16. Heapsort
17. Symbol table
18. Tries
19. Trees as arrays
20. 2-3-4 Trees basics.
