Connected Components:

1.  Connected components can be represented using a graph.
2.  These can be a graph of many vertices that create different components like c1(A,B,C)  C2(D,E) AND  C3(F,G,H)
3.  Our goal is to identify what is connected to what and to create a data structure that can be a reference.
4.  In above example we have A,B,C as 3 connected vertices while D and E are connected to each other but not with C1
5.  If there is a path between two vertices then they are considered as connected.
6.  This can be done with the  help of Adjacency Matrix but for large data-set it will need a lot of space.
7.  We will not use union fine because its different from graphs and does not give results in constant time.

8.  The data structure that we will build will be an array of ids that will store a specific value for vertices
    in a single connected component. These vertices will vary from component to component.
9.  The data structure can be created every time we create a Graph using dfs.
