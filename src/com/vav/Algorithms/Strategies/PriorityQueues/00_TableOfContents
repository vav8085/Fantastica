This file contains the main topics that i need to cover on priority queue. I am referring Karumanchi, Princeton Algorithms 1 and Robert Lafore
for theory and CTCI, Leetcode for Practice.

All the code can be found in Common folder for priority queue implementations, separate folders for each exercise book.

1.  Priority Queue Basics
2.  Priority Q Implementation
3.  Implementation using array with sorted insertions
