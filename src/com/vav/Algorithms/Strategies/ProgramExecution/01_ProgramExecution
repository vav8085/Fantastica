Program execution in memory:

1.  Memory has 4 parts:
    A.  code
    B.  data
    C.  stack
    D.  heap

Stacks:
    1.  All the methods and their local variables whose size can be computed go to stacks.
    2.  Stacks have a fixed size.
    3.  This is why objects do not save in stacks.
    4.  only object references and primitive types save in stack.
    5.  Every stack has a pointer to its previous element, this makes stacktrace.

Heap:
    1.  All the objects that can have variable sizes store in heap like Abstract types and arrays.
    2.  Heaps can expand.

Data:
    1.  All the global variables store in the data section and are available to every method in the stack.
