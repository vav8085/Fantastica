Quick Union:

1.  Quick union algorithm does the same thing of connecting items and
    finding connections but in a different way.
2.  We use the same data structure of arrays for storing our items.
3.  In quick union we do not save the value of the connecting vertex at
    the position of current vertex.
4.  Here we store values as a tree. Every vertex position in array saves its root.
5.  It makes a forest of disconnected trees of vertices.
6.  Whenever we want to connect some vertices we find the root of first vertex and
    we add it to the the bottom of other vertices root.
7.  Quick union can be improved if we weight every tree before adding it to the parent
    trees withe the lower height should be added to tree with more height.
