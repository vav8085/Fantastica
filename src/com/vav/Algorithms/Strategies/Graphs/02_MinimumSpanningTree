Minimum Spanning Tree:
1.  Minimum spanning tree is the path formed by smallest number of edges that can cover
    all vertices.
2.  We can use either DFS or BFS as traversing mechanism.
3.  There can be many mst depending on the start vertex selected.
4.  Using DFS when we create a MST we print the path from every start vertex to the next vertex.
