Directed Graph:
1.  Directed graph has direction arrows on the edges.
2.  We can traverse towards the arrow direction but not backwards.
3.  The adjacency matrix also has 1 for the values in direction of arrow and 0 backwards.
4.  The add edge method also has only 1 in direction of arrow.
    addEdge(int start, int end){ adjMatrix[start][end] = 1; }
5.  Same goes for adjacency list, if A has B in the list then B wont have A in its list.

DFS Examples:
****A use of DFS on directed graph is Garbage collector in Java. The garbage collector does a DFS on
    all the objects in the graph and finds the objects that are accessible from a specific set of objects(Roots).
    It then marks all the other objects that are not reachable for garbage collection.

****Another example of DFS is the algorithms that find dead code in your repository. They scan through all the
    method calls and the methods that are not called are shown to user as dead code.

BFS Examples:
****An Example of BFS is the GPS that finds the shortest route to a destination for you.

****Another example is webcrawler that crawls through a website visiting each link.
