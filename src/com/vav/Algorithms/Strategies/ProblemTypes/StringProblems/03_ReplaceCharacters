Move Characters:

These are the problems where you are given an array of characters or numbers and you are asked to replace some characters with something others.
The questions can be replace a with two d or 1 with 3 7s. The array may or may not have space. You may or may not be allowed to have additional space complexity

The way to solve these problems is by traversing array from behind. The reason we do it from behind is because its cheaper. We dont have to move all
the elements to the right to make space for a new one.

{1,2,3,1,5,6,-1,-1} replace 1 with two 7s

We will take two pointers, one starting from end and other from first non -1 number from end. Every timer we will get a number we will copy it to the end

{1,2,3,1,5,6,-1,-1}
{1,2,3,1,5,6,-1,6}
{1,2,3,1,5,6,5,6}
{1,2,3,1,7,7,5,6}
{1,2,3,3,7,7,5,6}
{1,2,2,3,7,7,5,6}
{7,7,2,3,7,7,5,6} done
