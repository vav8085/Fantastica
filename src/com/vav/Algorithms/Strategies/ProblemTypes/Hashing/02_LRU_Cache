LRU Cache:

LRU cache is used to remove least recently used item from the list.

We use two datastructures to implement a LRU cache.
1.  A doubly linked list to add, remove and update the entry in O(1) time
2.  A hashmap to keep the keys and the values as entries in doubly linked list.

**  Doubly linked list insertion and deletion and update is O(1) when you have direct reference to the element itself.
    This is the reason we keep a hashmap so we can access the elements in the doubly linked list faster.
