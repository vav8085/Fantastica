Hashing:
1.  HashTables can solve the problems for searching, insertion and sometimes deletion in O(1) time complexity.
2.  They are based on arrays and arrays have limited capicity and need copying to bigger array for expansion,
    Hashtables also face same issues.
3.  Hashmaps are bad if you want to visit elements in an order. you can only visit the element if you have its
    key value.
4.  In hashing KEYVALUES are transformed to ARRAYINDICES  using a HASH FUNCTION.
5.  Hash functions are not always required, sometimes you can use direct addressing.
6.  A simple hash function is big number % small range = small number.
7.  Load factor is the ratio of (Number of items in table/size of table).
8.  Load factor defines when HashTables need rehashing.

Separate Chaining:
1.  Separate Chaining is a collision resolution technique used in the Hashmaps.
2.  This works by adding a linked list or an array(bucket) at every cell on hashmap.
3.
