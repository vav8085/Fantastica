Warshall Algorithm:
1.  If we want to parse a directed graph we have to know its connectivity table
    Once we have connectivity table we have to look through every row that will take O(n) time.
    To do it in O(1) time we use Warshalls algorithm.
2.  Warshalls algorithm just modifies the Adjacency matrix so we can connect all vertices.
