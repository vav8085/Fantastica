Connectivity in Directed Graphs:
1.  In Undirected graphs we can find all the vertices using DFS.
2.  In Directed graphs we cannot go to every vertex from starting vertex.
3.  The DFS need to be modified to start at each vertex.
4.  WHen we will do this each vertex will parse its connected vertices forming a connectivity table.
