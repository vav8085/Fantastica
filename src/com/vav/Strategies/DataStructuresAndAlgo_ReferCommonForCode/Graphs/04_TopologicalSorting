Topological Sorting:
1.  Sometimes we need sorting our Map in the order of vertex values, The
    example can be sorting the courses in the order in which they can be taken
    or the order in which we need to use parts to build a car or any object.
    The sorting is called Topological Sort.
2.  We sort items by :
    A.  Finding the vertex that has no successors(no next vertices that it points to).
    B.  Delete this vertex and insert it to the first position.
    C.  Keep repeating it until there are no more vertices left.
        The final output will be the topologically sorted array.
    *   This will need deleting the vertex from vertex array and moving all the vertices
        one space to right to fill up the space.
    *   This will also need rearranging the adjacency matrix.
