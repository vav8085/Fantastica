Divide And Conquer:

1.  When we cannot solve a big problem we use divide and conquer to break this big problem into smaller
    sub-problems and solve them independently.
    It works in following way:
    A.  ***Break problem into non overlapping sub-problems of the same type.
    B.  Solve subproblems (We can use recursion here).
    C.  Combine results.

****Notice two words here:
    A.  non overlapping sub problems
    B.  Same type ( D& C cannot be applied on sub problems of different types).

2.  The sub-problems are of same type and non overlapping. The benefit of doing this is that we can now solve
    sub problems using the same algorithm we used for solving the larger problem using recursion.

3.  Linear search can be done recursively but its not a D&C approach because every element is visited from start to end
    the problem size reduces by only 1 at each step.
