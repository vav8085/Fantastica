Divide And Conquer:

1.  When we cannot solve a big problem we use divide and conquer to break this big problem into smaller
    sub-problems and solve them independently.
    It works in following way:
    A.  ***Break problem into non overlapping sub-problems of the same type.
    B.  Solve subproblems.
    C.  Combine results.

2.  The sub-problems are of same type and non overlapping. The benifit of doing this is that we can now solve
    subproblems using the same algorithm we used for solving the larger problem using recursion.
