This is a simple program in C to convert Strings to Integers.

Now how does this work:
1.  we have a string like "-1234"
2.  To convert this to integer we start parsing from start and go one character at a time.
3.  We subtract '0' from this character and so it get its integer value. This is because '0' char = 48 int so any numericChar - '0' = numericInt
4.  We multiply result by 10 and add this integer to it.

Solution - EPI Strings

Integer to Strings
1.  We cannot parse integers like we do with string. There is a trick to separate units digit from remaining number
2.  To find the units digit of a number simply % it by 10
3.  To separate units digit from a number simply divide it by 10
4.  Doing this in a loop until number becomes 0 we can keep adding each digit to a string buffer and thus convert
    a number to a string.
