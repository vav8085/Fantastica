Base Conversion:

The problem is to convert a string of integers from one base b1 to another base b2.

The problem is a combination of String -> Integer and Integer -> String problems.

We first go from left and convert the String to Integer.

Here instead of doing num = num * 10 + digit.... we do num = num * b1 + digit

We then convert this num to b2 by doing digit = num % b2 and num = num / b2

The difference is that if digit >=10 then we have to use A,B,C to represent them
In this case the result will become
    if(number % base2 >=10){
        stringBuilder.append((char)(number % base2 + 'A' - 10));
    }else{
        stringBuilder.append((char)(number % base2 + '0'));
    }
