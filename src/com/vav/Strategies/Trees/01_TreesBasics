Tree Basics:

1.  Trees are similar to linked lists but every node can point to many different nodes.
2.  Trees are non linear data structures.
3.  Tree is an ADT.
4.  In Trees order of elements is not important. --<<<< Check this point >>>>
5.  The root of the tree is the node with no parent and there can be only one root.
6.  An edge is a link from parent to child.
7.  A Node with no children is called the leaf.
8.  Nodes with the same parent are called siblings.
9.  Level(Node)---->Set of nodes at a depth is called level of the tree. Root is at level 0.
10. Depth(Node)---->The depth of the node is the number of edges you have to parse coming from root to that node.
11. Height(Node)--->The number of edges parsed from node to deepest node.
12. Height(Tree)--->The height of a tree is the number of edges parsed from root to the deepest node in the tree
    A tree with only root node got 0 height.
13. For a tree height and depth return the same value, but for a node it can be different.
