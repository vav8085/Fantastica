Binary Trees:

1.  A binary tree has a node with either 0, 1 or 2 clild nodes.
2.  Strict--->A binary tree is a strict binary tree if its every nodes has either 0 or 2 children. It will either take 2 or none.
3.  Full----->A binary tree is full when every node has exactly 2 childs and all leaves are at same level.
4.  Complete->A binary tree is complete if its all nodes are at height h or h-1 and if we number each node from 1->n then
    there should be no missing number. Every level is complete except the last one.
5.  The number of nodes in a full binary tree is 2^(h+1) - 1
6.  The number of nodes in a complete binary tree is between 2^h and 2^(h+1) - 1

Binary Tree Structure:

1.  A binary tree has a data and two links pointing to each child node.
