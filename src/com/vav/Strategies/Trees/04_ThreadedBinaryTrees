Threaded BinaryTree:

1.  Usually binary trees use stacks and queues for inorder, preorder, postorder and level order traversal.

2.  The problem with binary trees is that they have a lot of null pointers and the storage space for stacks and queues is large.

3.  During parsing a usual binary tree we have to find out the successor nodes ( inorder, preorder or postorder) . This is
    usually difficult to implement using a stack/queues.

4.
