N Ary or generic trees:

1.  In case we have a tree with more than two children then its difficult to represent all the links from a node.
    because the number of links can vary from node to node. And even if we allocate all nodes with maximum number of
    child count the memory will be huge and most of it will be wasted.
    So we cannot have this.
    class Node{
        Node child1;
        Node child2;
        Node child3;
        Node child4;
        .
        .
        .
    }
2.  To solve this problem we have to use something called Generic Trees.
3.  In generic trees we have a links between all the children of a parent. This means each node will have two attributes:
    leftChild, nextSibling
    Node{
        Data data;
        Node leftChild;
        Node nextSibling;
    }
4.  A generic tree and binary tree:
        Binary Tree:

                3
               / \
              4   5
             / \  /\
            6  7 8  9
        Generic Tree:
        
                3
               /
              4 -> 5
             /
            6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9
