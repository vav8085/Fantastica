Directed Graph:
1.  Directed graph has direction arrows on the edges.
2.  We can traverse towards the arrow direction but not backwards.
3.  The adjacency matrix also has 1 for the values in direction of arrow and 0 backwards.
4.  The add edge method also has only 1 in direction of arrow.
    addEdge(int start, int end){ adjMatrix[start][end] = 1; }
5.  Same goes for adjacency list, if A has B in the list then B wont have A in its list.
