Asymptotic Notations:

1.  We can represent an algorithm with a function F(N). The functions G(N) that gives the upper and lower
    bounds of the F(N) are called its asymptotes.
2.  This G(N) gives the closest bounds to F(N).

Big O Notation:

1.  The notation that gives the upper bound of a function is called its Big O function.
2.  F(N) = O(G(n)).
3.  Example is F(N) = N^4 + N then G(N) will be N^4.
4.  It also says that there exist a c and a N0 such that  0<=F(N)<=c*G(N) for a certain N>=N0.
5.  The above statement says that F(N) touches/intersect G(N) for a certain N if G(N) is multiplied by a constant c.
6.  Notice that we are interested in a certain large values of N where above condition is satisfied.
7.  Also notice that G(N) could be lower than F(N) at lower values of N but for values bigger than N0, G(N) is always > F(N).
8.  We discard lower order N terms here because thir rate of growth is not significant and does not impact much at
    larger values of N.
