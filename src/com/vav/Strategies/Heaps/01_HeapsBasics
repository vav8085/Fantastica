Heaps Basics:

1.  A heap is a complete binary tree.
2.  Its last row need not to be full.
3.  Its usually stored as an array.
4.  Its represented as a complete binary tree.
5.  The root is the maximum key.
6.  The heep condition: Every nodes key is larger than the key of its children.

Heaps are weekly ordered:

1.  In Binary Search Tree we know that the left child is smaller than root which is greater than right child.
    Because of this binary tree is easy to parse and search.
2.  In Heaps its difficult to search the nodes because the Heap Condition is not as helpful as BST.
3.  Heap traversal is also not as optimal and can take O(N) when parsing all the nodes to reach the required value.
4.  But the requirement is Fast Deletion of Maximum node(Root) and Fast Insertion on a new node and that is satisfied by Heap.
