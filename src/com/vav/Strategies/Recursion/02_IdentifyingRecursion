Identifying Recursion:

1.  Recursion can be seen in many natural patterns. Like tree branches, river branches, Romanesco broccoli etc.
    Larger structure appears to contain instances of itself at smaller scales.
    Many mathematical problems where nth term is defined through some formula or procedures involving previous terms.

2.  Recursive functions have 2 cases:
    Base case - The case when the output of a recursive problem can be identified trivially.
    Recursive case - The case where we have to apply more complex recursive solutions.
    E.g. In fibonacci equation s(n) = s(n-1) + s(n-2), n > 2;
    Base case is where s(0) = 1 and s(1) = 1
    So the sequence becomes 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 ...

3.  A recursive definition can have many base and recursive cases.

4.  Another example of a recursive function is factorial
    n! = 1x2x3x4.... n-1 x n
    here:
    n! = (n-1)! x n n > 0
    n! = 1 if n = 0

5. Another example can be finding the sum of items in a list with starting index of 0.
   Let the sum be s(a) and number of elements be n
   Because we are starting from 0 the last element will become n-1

   So if we are saying a[i] then it is the i+1th element in the list
                       a[0] is the 1st element
                       a[5] is the 6th element
   
   The recursive problem becomes:
   s(a) =
   if n <= 0
   , 0 (list is empty)
   else
   s(i=0->n-1 [a(i)]) + a(n-1)  (sum of first n-1 elements + nth element)

   Another way this problem can be described is
   s(a) =
   if n <= 0
   , 0 (list is empty)
   else
   a[0] + s(i=1->n [a(i)])  (sum of first n-1 elements + nth element)

   Another way can be by dividing the problem in two equal parts

   s(a) =
   0 if n=0
   a(0) if n=1
   s(i=0->n/2 [a(i)]) + s(j=n/2 -> n [a(j)]) if n>1
