Mathematical Induction:

*   Mathematical induction proves that we can climb as high as we like on a ladder, by proving that we can climb
    onto the bottom rung (the basis) and that from each rung we can climb up to the next one.

*   The method of induction requires two cases to be proved. The first case, called the base case (or, sometimes, the
    basis), proves that the property holds for the number 0. The second case, called the induction step, proves that, if
    the property holds for one natural number n, then it holds for the next natural number n + 1. These two steps establish
    the property P(n) for every natural number n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... The base step need not begin with zero. Often it
    begins with the number one, and it can begin with any natural number, establishing the truth of the property for all
    natural numbers greater than or equal to the starting number.
