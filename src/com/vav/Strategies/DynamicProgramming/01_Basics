Comparing with Greedy Strategy:

1.  We solved the minimum change problem using Greedy Strategy using a for loop. The algorithm works good for
    inputs like 10,5,1. But if we have an input of 25,20,5 then it fails to give 2 coins for a sum of 40.
2.  The problem here is that 25 will always be considered an input because its our geedy choice and by the time
    we reach 20 we have already solved a part of the problem.
3.  The greedy choice is not always the optimal. If we look at the car refueling problem then our initial goal is to
