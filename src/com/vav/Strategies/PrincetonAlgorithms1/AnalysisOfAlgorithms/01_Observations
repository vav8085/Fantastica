Observations:

1.  We need to make observations to calculate the running time of algorithm.
2.  We can do this manually by using a stopwatch or programmatically.
3.  We can use the Stopwatch class to calculate the elapsed time.
4.  Every time we double the input the time taken by threes sium problem will increase.
5.  If we plot between running time and problem size it will be the graph of n^3.
6.  if we take log both sides the grapk will be a straight line passing through origin.
7.  This graph will have a slope of 3.
8.  This is because T(N) = cN^3
    This becomes lg(T(N) = 3 lg(N) + c
    => lg(T(N) = b lg(N) + c
    y = mx+c
9.  There are many things that effect the runtime of a program.
    b is the algorithm and the input data.
    c is the hardware, software and system dependent effects.
