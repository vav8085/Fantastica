Tilde Notation

1.  If we have two functions f(x) and g(x), if f(x) is much larger than g(x) then we just
    ignore g(x).
    n^3 + 5n^2 + 1 is ~n^3
2.  For twos sum problem it will be ~N^2 and for threes sum problem it will be ~N^3.

Exact vs Approximate models

*   Exact models are for experts and approximate models are also good enough.
