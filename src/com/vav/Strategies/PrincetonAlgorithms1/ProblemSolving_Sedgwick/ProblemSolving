Problem Solving:
1.  Steps to develop a useful algorithms:
        A.  Model the problem - Understand the main elements of the problem.
        B.  Find the algorithm to solve the problem.
        C.  Take the Time and Space complexity estimates.
        D.  If problem complexities are not in required range find another way to solve the problem.
        E.  Iterate through the steps A->D until problem is solved.
