Quick Find:

1.  In Quick Find we usually use a datatype of a simple array.
2.  Whenever we need to check the connectivity of two items, we just parse through
    the array and check if the items have the same value. If two items have the same
    value then they are connected.
3.  For union we put the same value for all the items we want to connect.
