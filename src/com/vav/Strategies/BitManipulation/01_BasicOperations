Addition:

1.  Binary addition is similar to decimal addition. The only place where you need to take care of is an example like:
    1010+0110 this will return 10000 that takes 16 bits that is 8 bit more than the numbers added.


Ones Compliment:

1.  To do ones compliment of a number we change all the digits in binary from 1->0 and 0->1.
2.  So 1010 becomes 0101 and 1000 becomes 0111 and 0000 becomes 1111.

Twos Compliment:
1.  Twos compliment is used to represent positive and negative values in binary.
2.  If we two's compliment a positive number it converts the number to negative.
3.  Twos compliment is done by doing Ones compliment on any number and then adding a 1 to it.
4.  Adding a number to its twos compliment will give us 0.

Note:   10000011 -3d or is it 131d? There is no way to tell.

Note: When one bit is reserved for the sign bit, then there is one less bit available to store value information.
      This affects the range of positive values possible with a signed byte.
      A regular, unsigned byte can represent 256 unique values from 0 to 255 because all eight bits are used to store
      number data. However, a signed byte consisting of eight bits only has seven bits available to store number data
      because one bit is reserved for the sign. This reduces the maximum positive value by half, but at the same time, almost an equal
      number of negative values can be represented.

Subtraction:
1.  Borrow Method:
        Binary subtraction can be performed similar to decimal subtraction, just remember that when we add a carry to right digit
        it becomes 10 that is 2 in decimal. when we subtract 1 from it it becomes 1 in binary and in decimal.
        eg 0010 - 0001 = 0001 and its not 0000.
2.  2s Compliment method:
        We simply take 2s compliment of the subtrahend and add it to minuend. We discard the carry bit if we get any.

Left Shift operation << :
1.  We simply shift the bits to the left so 00001100 << 1 becomes 00011000.
2.  This is equivilant to multiplying a decimal number with a power of 2 so 12 becomes 12*2 = 24 = 00011000.
3.  The shifting is non-circular.

Logical Right Shift Operator >>>:
1.  This is opposite to the Left shift operator so 00001100>>1 becomes 00000110. ie 12 becomes 6
2.  If there is a loss of bits then they are gone. we cannot bring them back by shifting in other direction.

>> Arithematic Right Shift:
1.  In this shift we pad the shifted right bits with MSB that is the leftmost bit.
2.  This way we keep the sign bit intact after shifting after division by the power of 2.
3.  Arithematic right shift operator keeps the sign bit intact so if  11110000 is moved >> 2 then it returns 1001100

Masking:
1.  Masking is the way to create a mask of 1s or 0s around or in between some bits.
2.  If we use an AND operation with a mask then the mask bits of 0s will make other bit 0.
3.  If we use an OR operation with a mask then the mask bits of 1s will make other bit 1.
4.  A mask of 1s with an AND will work same as a mask of 0s with OR.

Bitwise operations:

    & operation - Does an AND operation on two bits 10001111 & 00001101 => 00001101
        1 & 1 becomes 1
        1 & 0 becomes 0
        0 & 0 becomes 0
    | operation - Does an OR operation on two bits 10001111 | 00001101 => 10001111
        1 | 1 becomes 1
        0 | 1 becomes 1
        1 | 0 becomes 1
        0 | 0 becomes 0
    ^ operation - Bitwise XOR operation copies the bits that are set in either operand 10001111 ^ 00001101 => 10000010
        1 ^ 1 becomes 0
        1 ^ 0 becomes 1
        0 ^ 1 becomes 1
        0 ^ 0 becomes 0
    ~ operation - Binary complimentary operator is a unary operator that flips bits.
        ~ 1   becomes 0
        ~ 0   becomes 1

Parity of a word:
THe parity of a word is 1 if number of 1 in the word is odd otherwise its 0.
