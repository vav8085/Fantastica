 * The algorithm will not first of all if the linked list has a loop.

 * The algorithm could be :
 * 1.   save all nodes of linked list in an array
 * 2.   sort the array
 * 3.   If two nodes point to same node they should be consecutive in this array
 * 4.   But if the list has a loop we will never be able to know when we have parsed all
