Guidelines for writing immutable classes
Writing immutable classes is easy. A class will be immutable if all of the following are true:

All of its fields are final
The class is declared final
The this reference is not allowed to escape during construction
Any fields that contain references to mutable objects, such as arrays, collections, or mutable classes like Date:
Are private
Are never returned or otherwise exposed to callers
Are the only reference to the objects that they reference
Do not change the state of the referenced objects after construction
