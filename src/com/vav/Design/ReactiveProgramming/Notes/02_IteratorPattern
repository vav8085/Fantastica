Iterator Pattern:

1.  Iterator pattern is used to iterate over an aggregate object(An object which contains other objects of same type)
2.  The iterator does not depend on the type of the object.
3.  Iterator is usually an interface which defines two methods hasNext() and next() to return next element.
