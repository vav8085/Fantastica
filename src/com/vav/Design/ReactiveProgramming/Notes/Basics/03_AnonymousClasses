Anonymous Classes:

1.  Anonymous classes are like expressions. They dont have a name just definition inside another expression.
2.  Suppose you have an interface Result with two methods success() and failure()
    interface Result{
        void success();
        void failure();
    }
3.  You can define a local class in your code like:
    Result result = new Result(){
        @Override
        success(){
            //implement
        }
        @Override
        failure(){
            //implement
        }
    };
4.  You can pass the result object anywhere and call its success and failure which are implemented above.6.
5.  Now in case this result object is passed at only once place to a method, you can simply pass the definition.
    void callService(Data data, new Result(){
                                        @Override
                                        success(){
                                            //implement
                                        }
                                        @Override
                                        failure(){
                                            //implement
                                        }
                                    });
6.  Above is like passing some code which can run once someone performs success or failure.
