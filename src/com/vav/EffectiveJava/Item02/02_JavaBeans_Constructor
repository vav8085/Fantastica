Java beans pattern can be used to construct objects with optional parameters.

You can have a constructor with no parameters and then have a getter or a setter for each parameters

Check the example IceCreamBean. We can also write this by passing mandatory parameters in constructor and only providing
getters and setters for optionals.

Limitations
The problem with JavaBeans constructor is that there is no strict check or enforcement on which parameters will
be included to create this object. People can omit certain and keep others. People may want to get values of parameters
that were never set and create bugs.
