Encapsulation:

Drawing a line around a cohesive set of data and functions.

In C programming language we have perfect encapsulation, all the methods are defined in header files and data remains in
implementation files.
C++ on thee other hand has broken encapsulation. We have to define data members in the header file that lets others
know about the data members available in our class, even if they are declared private.
Java has even broken encapsulation where we dont even have header classes.



Polymorphism:

Polymorphism is present in many languages. An example can be of C where getChar and putChar are used to write to STDIN
and STDOUT. STDIN and STDOUT can be any devices. In Unix os this device must qualify one requirement that is it must define
4 functions open, close, read, right, seek.
