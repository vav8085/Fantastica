Fantastica has my notes and learnings on Computer science, Algorithms and design from various books, websites, articles and some of my own work. The repository uses Java as programming language but most concepts discussed are common for all programming languages. 

Repository is organized in folders for each subject.

* Algorithms - This package contains various data structures and algorithms and their implementation in Java. 
  Algorithms section is further divided into 2 parts:
  
        1. Common - This package has implementation of various data structures and algorithms
        2. Strategies - This package has detailed notes about various data structure and algorithms

* Design - This package contains my notes on various software designing and architecturing techniques.

The end goal of this repository is to make it easier for users to learn computer science subjects.

All the references are mentioned in notes.
